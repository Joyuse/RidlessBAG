# RidlessBAG
My application for iOS, task manager.
I try use MVVM when create this application.
My design(ingenious(NO)) - https://www.figma.com/file/exgbfRdKWSiPxM7pD5FC7v/Ridless-Bag?node-id=0%3A1
The database will be used by Google Firebase, all changes will be scattered across the branches. Over time, I think I can learn how to create my own REST using Swagger.
These are my first steps in the world of iOS development. I would be glad to receive comments and advice.
